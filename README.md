 
## ðŸŒ¸ **Iris Flower Classification â€“ From Machine Learning to Deployment**

**Project Type:** Supervised Learning Â· Classification Â· Deployment
**Goal:** Predict the species of an Iris flower (*Setosa*, *Versicolor*, or *Virginica*) based on its physical measurements.

---

### âœ… **Problem Statement**

The Iris dataset is a classic machine learning problem used to classify flowers into three species based on four key features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

---

### ðŸŽ¯ **Objective**

To build an end-to-end machine learning pipeline that:

* Accurately predicts the species of an Iris flower
* Is optimized for performance
* Is deployed as an interactive web application

---

### ðŸ“Š **Dataset Overview**

* **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository
* **Features:**

  * `sepal_length`
  * `sepal_width`
  * `petal_length`
  * `petal_width`
* **Target:** `species` (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

---

### ðŸ§  **Approach**

1. **Data Preprocessing:**

   * Handled missing values (if any)
   * Visualized feature distributions and relationships using seaborn/matplotlib
2. **Model Building:**

   * Trained multiple classifiers: Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest, and SVM
   * Evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
   * Selected the best-performing model
3. **Deployment:**

   * Built a user-friendly web app using **Streamlit**
   * Allowed users to input flower measurements and get real-time predictions
   * Hosted locally or on platforms like **Streamlit Cloud**

---

### ðŸ’¡ **Key Learnings & Skills Demonstrated**

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Feature scaling and encoding
* Model evaluation and selection
* Streamlit for app deployment
* User input handling and model integration in a live environment

---

### ðŸš€ **Result**

Achieved **over 95% accuracy** in classifying Iris species. The model is now accessible through a simple web interface where users can test predictions instantly.
